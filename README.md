# VideoChat_Application
The application allows users to make video calls with one another, with the video and audio streams transmitted using WebRTC technology. Firebase is used as a backend to manage signaling, and messaging between clients.


TECHNOLOGY USED

To develop the video call app, we used several technologies and tools, including:-

WebRTC: a free and open-source project that provides real-time communication capabilities to web browsers and mobile applications.
    
Firebase: a cloud-based platform that provides a range of services, including database management, and real-time messaging.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: standard web development technologies used to create the user interface and client-side functionality of the app.
